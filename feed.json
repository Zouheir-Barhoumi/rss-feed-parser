Farley said 2023 would be pivotal for the automaker. The company&#8217;s reorganization, which kicked off in March 2022, was designed to give the 118-year-old Michigan automaker the speed of a startup. It also shifted how it viewed earnings opportunities, saying it expected EVs to account for 50% of its global sales by 2030, up from 40% under previous guidance. The operating profit margin is expected to increase to 10% by 2026, up from 8%.</p>\n<h2>Breakdown of the numbers</h2>\n<p>Ford generated $44 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 17% from the $37.7 billion in revenue it reported in the same period last year.

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The hackers who reportedly hit more than 130 organizations last year and stole the credentials of almost 10,000 employees are still targeting several tech and video game companies, according to a report obtained by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The report, prepared by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, calls the hackers “Scattered Spider.” <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid-detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In a previous publicly available report</a>, the company said this group is also known as “Roasted 0ktapus” in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://blog.group-ib.com/0ktapus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the report</a> published by Group-IB, another cybersecurity firm, last year.</p>\n<p>Reports like the one obtained by TechCrunch are prepared by threat intelligence companies for their customers, with the idea of alerting them to hackers who are either targeting the customers directly, or other companies in the same sector. In the report, CrowdStrike notes that it has limited visibility into the hacking campaign given that it has no “additional forensic artifacts,” referring to data it obtained directly from targeted organizations. That’s why the company admits it has “low confidence” in its assessment that this is activity by Scattered Spider.</p>\n<p>Two cybersecurity insiders, who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the press, said that the understanding within the industry is that Scattered Spider is the same group as 0ktapus.</p>\n<p>“Scattered Spider continued deploying numerous phishing pages in January 2023. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the adversary has likely expanded its target scope to include technology sector companies specializing in gaming or financial software, while maintaining a prior focus on business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and cellular providers,” read the report, which is not publicly available.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if this is the same group that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/riot-games-hack-cheaters/\">hacked Riot Games last month</a>, but in a list of phishing domains included in the CrowdStrike report, there’s one that was clearly made to target the video game giant given that it includes the name of the company in the URL.</p>\n<p>Among the phishing domains, there’s also others tailored to impersonate video game makers Roblox and Zynga, email marketing and newsletter giant Mailchimp and its parent company Intuit, Salesforce, Comcast, and Grubhub. TaskUs, a contractor that provides customer service for companies, including Mailchimp, Intuit and other tech giants, was also on the list.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In January, Mailchimp <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/mailchimp-hacked/\">disclosed that it had been hacked</a> — the second hack against the company in six months. At the time, Mailchimp said the hackers targeted its employees via phishing. It’s unclear if this incident is tied to the activities of Scattered Spider. Mailchimp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Riot declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Salesforce spokesperson Allen Tsai said that the company is &#8220;aware of and monitor phishing campaigns industry-wide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At this time, we have no indication of unauthorized access to customer data relevant to the cited report,&#8221; Tsai said in an email.</p>\n<p>An Intuit spokesperson did not comment as they had not seen the report.</p>\n<p>Roblox, Zynga, TaskUs, Comcast and Grubhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The report said that “the majority” of the hacking group’s phishing pages were designed to mimic Okta login portals, “while a much smaller number impersonated Microsoft.”</p>\n<p>CrowdStrike did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you a Google Fi subscriber that was also a victim of a similar attack?

      "#": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The hackers who reportedly hit more than 130 organizations last year and stole the credentials of almost 10,000 employees are still targeting several tech and video game companies, according to a report obtained by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The report, prepared by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, calls the hackers “Scattered Spider.” <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid-detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In a previous publicly available report</a>, the company said this group is also known as “Roasted 0ktapus” in an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://blog.group-ib.com/0ktapus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the report</a> published by Group-IB, another cybersecurity firm, last year.</p>\n<p>Reports like the one obtained by TechCrunch are prepared by threat intelligence companies for their customers, with the idea of alerting them to hackers who are either targeting the customers directly, or other companies in the same sector. In the report, CrowdStrike notes that it has limited visibility into the hacking campaign given that it has no “additional forensic artifacts,” referring to data it obtained directly from targeted organizations. That’s why the company admits it has “low confidence” in its assessment that this is activity by Scattered Spider.</p>\n<p>Two cybersecurity insiders, who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the press, said that the understanding within the industry is that Scattered Spider is the same group as 0ktapus.</p>\n<p>“Scattered Spider continued deploying numerous phishing pages in January 2023. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses the adversary has likely expanded its target scope to include technology sector companies specializing in gaming or financial software, while maintaining a prior focus on business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and cellular providers,” read the report, which is not publicly available.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if this is the same group that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/24/riot-games-hack-cheaters/\">hacked Riot Games last month</a>, but in a list of phishing domains included in the CrowdStrike report, there’s one that was clearly made to target the video game giant given that it includes the name of the company in the URL.</p>\n<p>Among the phishing domains, there’s also others tailored to impersonate video game makers Roblox and Zynga, email marketing and newsletter giant Mailchimp and its parent company Intuit, Salesforce, Comcast, and Grubhub. TaskUs, a contractor that provides customer service for companies, including Mailchimp, Intuit and other tech giants, was also on the list.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In January, Mailchimp <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/mailchimp-hacked/\">disclosed that it had been hacked</a> — the second hack against the company in six months. At the time, Mailchimp said the hackers targeted its employees via phishing. It’s unclear if this incident is tied to the activities of Scattered Spider. Mailchimp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Riot declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Salesforce spokesperson Allen Tsai said that the company is &#8220;aware of and monitor phishing campaigns industry-wide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At this time, we have no indication of unauthorized access to customer data relevant to the cited report,&#8221; Tsai said in an email.</p>\n<p>An Intuit spokesperson did not comment as they had not seen the report.</p>\n<p>Roblox, Zynga, TaskUs, Comcast and Grubhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The report said that “the majority” of the hacking group’s phishing pages were designed to mimic Okta login portals, “while a much smaller number impersonated Microsoft.”</p>\n<p>CrowdStrike did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you a Google Fi subscriber that was also a victim of a similar attack?

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">New references in Instagram&#8217;s code suggest the company could be developing a paid verification feature following the rollout of a similar system at Twitter under Elon Musk. Recently discovered code snippets reference explicitly refer to a &#8220;paid blue badge&#8221; and a new subscription product, a developer has discovered. The same reference also appears in the latest build of the Facebook app, indicating paid verification could be offered across Meta&#8217;s platforms if the product continued to be developed.</p>\n<p>The discovery was made by developer and reverse engineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who has previously spotted a number of new Instagram features before they launched, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/instagram-scheduling-tool-all-professional-accounts/?guccounter=2&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9haW4udWEv&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALqUj2XiZbyUdQQRDkhXU1IdG9UWBLz_LC8DVIaL0s9THLr-zsBWS_Azv7Fdcaz224-hu_gO6sLmfGqMm4B4kVhz4ab0RfdrNHWEQDUOM3GTLuq5Dfp3dO9Bckw5GwabRtmxwqNR42RPUh-2zomlMotOZzMnzOvvRLLElkyDL6eK#!\">in-app scheduling tool</a> that launched in November and the newer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/instagram-is-now-allowing-users-to-share-posts-reels-and-locations-through-qr-codes/?_guc_consent_skip=1661436636#!\">QR code sharing features</a>. He&#8217;s also regularly spotted other internal prototypes, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/instagrams-latest-feature-test-is-about-being-bereal/#!\">Instagram&#8217;s Candid Challenges</a> and features in development with Twitter.</p>\n<p>Typically, Instagram confirms its smaller tests or prototypes when discovered, but in the case of the paid verification option, the company chose not to comment.</p>\n<p>Given Paluzzi&#8217;s track record, however, it&#8217;s worth at least speculating why Instagram could be weighing a decision around paid verification.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Paluzzi shared with TechCrunch screenshots in the app&#8217;s code that included lines referencing &#8220;IG_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV&#8221; and &#8220;FB_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV.&#8221; He suggested that, given the context, &#8220;IDV&#8221; could mean identity verification &#8212; as that&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://insights.namescan.io/knowledgebase/identity-verification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a known</a> <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/blog/what-is-identity-verification-idv-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meaning</a> for the acronym.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479539\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2479539\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg 888w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=768,292 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=680,259 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">code screenshots from Alessandro Paluzzi <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>\n<p>In addition, the developer told us he found other references to a new type of subscription product that hadn&#8217;t been there previously. The same references were also in one of the latest builds of the Facebook app, he noted.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Still, Paluzzi cautioned that there&#8217;s nothing yet visible in the app itself beyond these small code references, so we can only speculate on these findings for the time being.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s fun speculation to be had, especially considering the misery that is today&#8217;s Instagram verification system.</p>\n<p>The subject of numerous complaints over the years, Instagram&#8217;s verification system is obtuse, complicated, and seemingly random, due to its reliance on automation. Although Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/\">in 2018 began allowing users</a> to request verification, the overall system itself hasn&#8217;t changed much, despite Instagram head <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1272592295792013313\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam Mosseri&#8217;s promise</a> that account verification would be a focus of improvement back in 2020.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/\">You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram — here&#8217;s how</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram — here&#8217;s how&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/embed/#?secret=bMdIwjiHYR#?secret=FivYZI473C\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Currently, the coveted blue badge is still only awarded to high-profile individuals, celebrities, and global brands or entities. But everyday users and smaller creators have long sought similar recognition. That&#8217;s led to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/instagram-verification-paid-black-market-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a multimillion-dollar shadow market</a> for verification where people pay thousands of dollars for the blue badges through backchannel means. Last year, in fact, a ProPublica investigation revealed one of the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/instagram-spotify-verified-fake-musicians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest Instagram verification schemes</a> to date, which resulted in Meta having to remove illicitly gained badges from hundreds of accounts. In other words, there&#8217;s clearly demand for paid verification.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s something Elon Musk believes as well, as he quickly made paid verification a key selling point for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/25/elon-musk-says-twitters-new-multicoloured-verification-will-launch-next-week/\">Twitter&#8217;s revamped Twitter Blue subscription</a>. Unfortunately, Twitter&#8217;s implementation was not well thought out, leading to widespread impersonation on the network as users changed their names and profile photos to well-known individuals or brands, which then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/fake-twitter-blue-check-lebron-musk/\">caused serious mischief</a>. Twitter had to almost immediately pause paid verification and retool, ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/11/twitter-blue-to-relaunch-with-actual-verification-process-higher-price-for-apple-users/\">relaunching</a> with gold badges for businesses and additional verification steps.</p>\n<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s initial attempts to monetize verification were chaotic, that doesn&#8217;t mean the idea itself has no value. Plus, advances in AI could help improve the verification process. Already, Instagram uses AI in other parts of its app &#8212; like finding which accounts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/instagram-will-require-users-to-provide-their-birthday/\">belong to kids who lied about their age</a> as well as content recommendations.</p>\n<p>In addition, Twitter isn&#8217;t the only major social app testing consumer demand for paid subscriptions. Snapchat also caters to its power users with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">Snapchat+ subscription</a> that offers a laundry list of perks and extra features. During this week&#8217;s earnings call, the company announced it had grown Snapchat+ to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/snapchat-now-has-more-than-2-million-paid-subscribers/\">over 2 million subscribers</a> in just over half a year&#8217;s time.</p>\n<p>If it chose, Instagram could offer a subscription bundle to its own power users, which could include a paid blue badge and other features. While it&#8217;s not clear at the time that&#8217;s what it has in the works, it would be interesting to see such a product come to fruition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com or 415.234.3994 on Signal.  </em></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/is-instagram-considering-paid-verification-code-reveals-references-to-a-paid-blue-badge/\">Is Instagram considering paid verification?

      "#": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">New references in Instagram&#8217;s code suggest the company could be developing a paid verification feature following the rollout of a similar system at Twitter under Elon Musk. Recently discovered code snippets reference explicitly refer to a &#8220;paid blue badge&#8221; and a new subscription product, a developer has discovered. The same reference also appears in the latest build of the Facebook app, indicating paid verification could be offered across Meta&#8217;s platforms if the product continued to be developed.</p>\n<p>The discovery was made by developer and reverse engineer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who has previously spotted a number of new Instagram features before they launched, including the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/08/instagram-scheduling-tool-all-professional-accounts/?guccounter=2&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9haW4udWEv&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALqUj2XiZbyUdQQRDkhXU1IdG9UWBLz_LC8DVIaL0s9THLr-zsBWS_Azv7Fdcaz224-hu_gO6sLmfGqMm4B4kVhz4ab0RfdrNHWEQDUOM3GTLuq5Dfp3dO9Bckw5GwabRtmxwqNR42RPUh-2zomlMotOZzMnzOvvRLLElkyDL6eK#!\">in-app scheduling tool</a> that launched in November and the newer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/instagram-is-now-allowing-users-to-share-posts-reels-and-locations-through-qr-codes/?_guc_consent_skip=1661436636#!\">QR code sharing features</a>. He&#8217;s also regularly spotted other internal prototypes, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/23/instagrams-latest-feature-test-is-about-being-bereal/#!\">Instagram&#8217;s Candid Challenges</a> and features in development with Twitter.</p>\n<p>Typically, Instagram confirms its smaller tests or prototypes when discovered, but in the case of the paid verification option, the company chose not to comment.</p>\n<p>Given Paluzzi&#8217;s track record, however, it&#8217;s worth at least speculating why Instagram could be weighing a decision around paid verification.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Paluzzi shared with TechCrunch screenshots in the app&#8217;s code that included lines referencing &#8220;IG_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV&#8221; and &#8220;FB_NME_PAID_BLUE_BADGE_IDV.&#8221; He suggested that, given the context, &#8220;IDV&#8221; could mean identity verification &#8212; as that&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://insights.namescan.io/knowledgebase/identity-verification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a known</a> <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/blog/what-is-identity-verification-idv-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meaning</a> for the acronym.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479539\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2479539\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg 888w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=300,114 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=768,292 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=680,259 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paid-blue-badge.jpg?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479539\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">code screenshots from Alessandro Paluzzi <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>\n<p>In addition, the developer told us he found other references to a new type of subscription product that hadn&#8217;t been there previously. The same references were also in one of the latest builds of the Facebook app, he noted.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Still, Paluzzi cautioned that there&#8217;s nothing yet visible in the app itself beyond these small code references, so we can only speculate on these findings for the time being.</p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s fun speculation to be had, especially considering the misery that is today&#8217;s Instagram verification system.</p>\n<p>The subject of numerous complaints over the years, Instagram&#8217;s verification system is obtuse, complicated, and seemingly random, due to its reliance on automation. Although Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/\">in 2018 began allowing users</a> to request verification, the overall system itself hasn&#8217;t changed much, despite Instagram head <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1272592295792013313\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adam Mosseri&#8217;s promise</a> that account verification would be a focus of improvement back in 2020.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/\">You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram — here&#8217;s how</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;You can now apply to get a verified badge on Instagram — here&#8217;s how&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/instagram-how-to-get-verified/embed/#?secret=bMdIwjiHYR#?secret=FivYZI473C\" data-secret=\"FivYZI473C\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Currently, the coveted blue badge is still only awarded to high-profile individuals, celebrities, and global brands or entities. But everyday users and smaller creators have long sought similar recognition. That&#8217;s led to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/instagram-verification-paid-black-market-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a multimillion-dollar shadow market</a> for verification where people pay thousands of dollars for the blue badges through backchannel means. Last year, in fact, a ProPublica investigation revealed one of the <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/instagram-spotify-verified-fake-musicians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest Instagram verification schemes</a> to date, which resulted in Meta having to remove illicitly gained badges from hundreds of accounts. In other words, there&#8217;s clearly demand for paid verification.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s something Elon Musk believes as well, as he quickly made paid verification a key selling point for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/25/elon-musk-says-twitters-new-multicoloured-verification-will-launch-next-week/\">Twitter&#8217;s revamped Twitter Blue subscription</a>. Unfortunately, Twitter&#8217;s implementation was not well thought out, leading to widespread impersonation on the network as users changed their names and profile photos to well-known individuals or brands, which then <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/09/fake-twitter-blue-check-lebron-musk/\">caused serious mischief</a>. Twitter had to almost immediately pause paid verification and retool, ultimately <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/11/twitter-blue-to-relaunch-with-actual-verification-process-higher-price-for-apple-users/\">relaunching</a> with gold badges for businesses and additional verification steps.</p>\n<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s initial attempts to monetize verification were chaotic, that doesn&#8217;t mean the idea itself has no value. Plus, advances in AI could help improve the verification process. Already, Instagram uses AI in other parts of its app &#8212; like finding which accounts <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/instagram-will-require-users-to-provide-their-birthday/\">belong to kids who lied about their age</a> as well as content recommendations.</p>\n<p>In addition, Twitter isn&#8217;t the only major social app testing consumer demand for paid subscriptions. Snapchat also caters to its power users with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/29/snapchat-officially-introduces-its-paid-subscription-at-3-99-per-month/\">Snapchat+ subscription</a> that offers a laundry list of perks and extra features. During this week&#8217;s earnings call, the company announced it had grown Snapchat+ to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/snapchat-now-has-more-than-2-million-paid-subscribers/\">over 2 million subscribers</a> in just over half a year&#8217;s time.</p>\n<p>If it chose, Instagram could offer a subscription bundle to its own power users, which could include a paid blue badge and other features. While it&#8217;s not clear at the time that&#8217;s what it has in the works, it would be interesting to see such a product come to fruition.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Sarah Perez can be reached at sarahp@techcrunch.com or 415.234.3994 on Signal.  </em></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/is-instagram-considering-paid-verification-code-reveals-references-to-a-paid-blue-badge/\">Is Instagram considering paid verification?

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A lot has happened in the half-year since we caught up with Ayanna Howard, dean of the Ohio State University’s College of Engineering — not all of it good. The broader economic slowdown has been deeply felt by the robotics industry, across the board, from the smallest startups to the biggest tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon.</p>\n<p>Understandably, a lot of the coverage has centered around the impact and companies and those who’ve lost jobs in the process. One key thing we don’t discuss as often are the people currently hunting for jobs — both those who are recently out of one and people who are brand-new to the market.</p>\n<p>Catching up with Dean Howard is a perfect opportunity to discuss the latter, both in terms of what the market looks like for recent and soon-to-be grads and what companies can do to recruit and engage folks who are brand-new to the job market. This week, we’re kicking things off with that Q&amp;A, then diving into the first batch of job listings we promised last week and moving on to your regularly scheduled robotics roundup.</p>\n<p>Actuator, activate!</p>\n<h2>Q&amp;A with Dean Ayanna Howard</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2265993\" style=\"width: 1552px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2265993\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2265993 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1542\" height=\"1599\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg 1542w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=289,300 289w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=768,796 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=656,680 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=1481,1536 1481w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=1157,1200 1157w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dean-Ayanna-Howard-Ohio-State.jpg?resize=48,50 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1542px) 100vw, 1542px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2265993\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ayanna Howard, dean of the Ohio State University’s College of Engineering <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Logan Wallace / Ohio State University</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>TC: How are your students feeling about the job market — robotics in particular?</strong></p>\n<p>AH: I think there’s a little bit of apprehension, but the fact is there’s still jobs that are open, especially for new hires. When you’re new talent, you’re at a lower rate, obviously. Sometimes you’re more creative and willing to do a little more than what the job is, because you don’t know what the job is.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><strong>Prior to the downturn, were students more excited to go into the world of Big Tech or startups?</strong></p>\n<p>It was mixed. I really depended on whether they [had a] bachelor&#8217;s or a master&#8217;s. I found that a lot of students, if they were going to go into the startup world, it would be with a mature startup. It wasn’t one that was just a year or two out. It was one that had at least a Series A. […] Now I think there’s more of a focus on, ‘Let’s go with a large, more established company, just because they’ll last.</p>\n<p><strong>Now robotics is something that touches every other category, so there are a lot of robotics jobs to be had outside of strictly robotics companies.</strong></p>\n<p>Correct. I consider self-driving cars to be robotics. It’s everything. You have control systems, you have autonomy, you have interaction with people. It’s a classic robotics system that just happens to have a car form factor. Even in that domain, you saw a lot of startups close down, but the large companies have invested a lot more into that and EVs.</p>\n<p><strong>What can schools do to train students for the job market?</strong></p>\n<p>At Ohio State, we have instituted some programs within the last year around entrepreneurism in startups, around very specific areas. For example, manufacturing, healthcare. Things that we know we’ll always need innovation in. Large companies need that entrepreneurial thinking and mindset, because it allows them to innovate within the company structure. When companies don’t innovate, they tend to be archaic, and when the startup culture comes back up, they’re gonna eat their corn.</p>\n<p><strong>As far as your own experience running a startup, how did you determine when to hire a student versus someone more senior?</strong></p>\n<p>For the technical talent, it was really new hires. It was because I needed fresh ideas. We needed to know the latest and the greatest, and they would have the education. For marketing and sales, that was much more established. We hired much more seasoned individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>What tips would you give for startups hiring recent grads?</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t put them on a critical path, starting off, because you might be disappointed if they don’t rise to the challenge. But do give them things that require them to push the boundary conditions. If you hire them for front-end development or graphics, think about things that are tangential that I can push them in so that they can learn. […] You, as a manager, have to be much more strategic, and you have to lay it out.</p>\n<p>You do still have to do a little hand-holding. I don’t want to call it &#8220;micromanagement,&#8221; but you do have to set deliverables, set milestones, and if they don’t meet it, go back and ask them why they didn’t meet it. Not reprimanding, but asking why. Sometimes what you’ll find is they’ll get stuck in certain areas you didn’t anticipate, and then you can push them.</p>\n<p><strong>I tend to think generational warfare is silly, but what would you say to those people who suggest that younger millennials and Gen Z are too sensitive or don’t have a work ethic?</strong></p>\n<p>I think their motivation is different. The work ethic versus the too sensitive — this generation is passionate about certain things. They are impassionate about others. When you find what they’re passionate about, whatever it is — social impact or design software for underserved communities — you get them there and they will work throughout the night. When we think about work ethic, it&#8217;s &#8220;You’ve got to show up to work every day.&#8221; But if they’re not interested, they can be a little slower or not responsive. It’s a different type of work ethic.</p>\n<h2>Job Openings</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2157953\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2157953 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a person talking to two colleagues via videoconferencing.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg 6250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images / Olga Strelnikova</p></div></p>\n<p>There’s a sense of helplessness associated with economic downturns. It’s the knowledge that — in the long run — no one’s job is truly safe. The way we’ve structured society means the farther down the ladder you are in regards to money and seniority, the more you’re regarded as being expendable.</p>\n<p>For those who’ve been spared, there’s little consolation in a corporation’s pledge to be more scrappy and return to its long-dormant startup roots when you’ve seen so many colleagues suddenly out of work. For those of us who’ve been through that experience, it’s clear that corporate layoffs are indiscriminate when it comes to the individual. When push comes to shove, we all become rounding errors.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen a lot of positive feedback on social media reiterating the fact that layoffs aren’t personal. Certainly that’s true for the company doing the laying off, but it’s quite the opposite for the people on the receiving end. Layoffs are deeply personal. They disrupt our lives, our livelihoods, our motivations, our relationships. They contribute to depression and a laundry list of different conditions.</p>\n<p>As someone who’s been working in the world of publishing for a long time now, I’ve been on the receiving end a few times. I understand that you can tell someone that something isn’t their fault a million times over, but it can feel like a platitude. Moral support is extremely important during the process — but so are actionable items. Help good people find good jobs. We talk a lot about how work shouldn’t define you, but it takes up more waking hours than anything else. People should be able to find work that is fulfilling and makes them feel valued.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’d like you to take away from this, it’s the fact that people are hurting. If you can help, help. Simple, I know, but if you need a less altruistic motivator, understand that the people you help now may well be in a position to help you later.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping we can use Actuator as a platform to do just that. As I mentioned previously, each week I’m going to feature a handful of companies in the robotics space that are hiring. I don’t have a timeline for how long we’ll be running this — a lot of that depends on the level of interest among job seekers. The plan for the moment, however, is to keep this going during the current downturn.</p>\n<p>I learned a long time ago that hiring is a key reason companies seek out coverage at a place like TechCrunch, and I understand that Actuator’s readers are precisely the sort of people these organizations are looking for. We’re not becoming a job board and won’t post individual positions, but hopefully curating a list will prove useful for job seekers.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to be included, shoot me a line with your company’s name and how many positions you’re hiring for (if you don’t include the number, I will attempt to count). And, hey, if you end up landing a new gig based on something you found here, let me know on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bheater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a>.

Companies like DHL are the seemingly perfect target for the product, and fittingly, the logistics giant became one of Boston Dynamics&#8217; first customers, with a $15 million product purchase a year ago last week.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2478840\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2478840\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2478840\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg 3260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=1200,683 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-01-at-4.17.01-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2478840\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology (KAIST)</p></div></p>\n<p>Taking us out this week is Raibo, a robot dog recently highlighted in the pages of <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ade2256\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Science Robotics</a> that’s capable of running on sand at high speeds.

When you’re new talent, you’re at a lower rate, obviously. Sometimes you’re more creative and willing to do a little more than what the job is, because you don’t know what the job is.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><strong>Prior to the downturn, were students more excited to go into the world of Big Tech or startups?</strong></p>\n<p>It was mixed. I really depended on whether they [had a] bachelor&#8217;s or a master&#8217;s. I found that a lot of students, if they were going to go into the startup world, it would be with a mature startup. It wasn’t one that was just a year or two out. It was one that had at least a Series A. […] Now I think there’s more of a focus on, ‘Let’s go with a large, more established company, just because they’ll last.</p>\n<p><strong>Now robotics is something that touches every other category, so there are a lot of robotics jobs to be had outside of strictly robotics companies.</strong></p>\n<p>Correct. I consider self-driving cars to be robotics. It’s everything. You have control systems, you have autonomy, you have interaction with people. It’s a classic robotics system that just happens to have a car form factor. Even in that domain, you saw a lot of startups close down, but the large companies have invested a lot more into that and EVs.</p>\n<p><strong>What can schools do to train students for the job market?</strong></p>\n<p>At Ohio State, we have instituted some programs within the last year around entrepreneurism in startups, around very specific areas. For example, manufacturing, healthcare. Things that we know we’ll always need innovation in. Large companies need that entrepreneurial thinking and mindset, because it allows them to innovate within the company structure. When companies don’t innovate, they tend to be archaic, and when the startup culture comes back up, they’re gonna eat their corn.</p>\n<p><strong>As far as your own experience running a startup, how did you determine when to hire a student versus someone more senior?</strong></p>\n<p>For the technical talent, it was really new hires. It was because I needed fresh ideas. We needed to know the latest and the greatest, and they would have the education. For marketing and sales, that was much more established. We hired much more seasoned individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>What tips would you give for startups hiring recent grads?</strong></p>\n<p>Don’t put them on a critical path, starting off, because you might be disappointed if they don’t rise to the challenge. But do give them things that require them to push the boundary conditions. If you hire them for front-end development or graphics, think about things that are tangential that I can push them in so that they can learn. […] You, as a manager, have to be much more strategic, and you have to lay it out.</p>\n<p>You do still have to do a little hand-holding. I don’t want to call it &#8220;micromanagement,&#8221; but you do have to set deliverables, set milestones, and if they don’t meet it, go back and ask them why they didn’t meet it. Not reprimanding, but asking why. Sometimes what you’ll find is they’ll get stuck in certain areas you didn’t anticipate, and then you can push them.</p>\n<p><strong>I tend to think generational warfare is silly, but what would you say to those people who suggest that younger millennials and Gen Z are too sensitive or don’t have a work ethic?</strong></p>\n<p>I think their motivation is different. The work ethic versus the too sensitive — this generation is passionate about certain things. They are impassionate about others. When you find what they’re passionate about, whatever it is — social impact or design software for underserved communities — you get them there and they will work throughout the night. When we think about work ethic, it&#8217;s &#8220;You’ve got to show up to work every day.&#8221; But if they’re not interested, they can be a little slower or not responsive. It’s a different type of work ethic.</p>\n<h2>Job Openings</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2157953\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2157953 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a person talking to two colleagues via videoconferencing.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg 6250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2157953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images / Olga Strelnikova</p></div></p>\n<p>There’s a sense of helplessness associated with economic downturns. It’s the knowledge that — in the long run — no one’s job is truly safe. The way we’ve structured society means the farther down the ladder you are in regards to money and seniority, the more you’re regarded as being expendable.</p>\n<p>For those who’ve been spared, there’s little consolation in a corporation’s pledge to be more scrappy and return to its long-dormant startup roots when you’ve seen so many colleagues suddenly out of work. For those of us who’ve been through that experience, it’s clear that corporate layoffs are indiscriminate when it comes to the individual. When push comes to shove, we all become rounding errors.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen a lot of positive feedback on social media reiterating the fact that layoffs aren’t personal. Certainly that’s true for the company doing the laying off, but it’s quite the opposite for the people on the receiving end. Layoffs are deeply personal. They disrupt our lives, our livelihoods, our motivations, our relationships. They contribute to depression and a laundry list of different conditions.</p>\n<p>As someone who’s been working in the world of publishing for a long time now, I’ve been on the receiving end a few times. I understand that you can tell someone that something isn’t their fault a million times over, but it can feel like a platitude. Moral support is extremely important during the process — but so are actionable items. Help good people find good jobs. We talk a lot about how work shouldn’t define you, but it takes up more waking hours than anything else. People should be able to find work that is fulfilling and makes them feel valued.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’d like you to take away from this, it’s the fact that people are hurting. If you can help, help. Simple, I know, but if you need a less altruistic motivator, understand that the people you help now may well be in a position to help you later.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping we can use Actuator as a platform to do just that. As I mentioned previously, each week I’m going to feature a handful of companies in the robotics space that are hiring. I don’t have a timeline for how long we’ll be running this — a lot of that depends on the level of interest among job seekers. The plan for the moment, however, is to keep this going during the current downturn.</p>\n<p>I learned a long time ago that hiring is a key reason companies seek out coverage at a place like TechCrunch, and I understand that Actuator’s readers are precisely the sort of people these organizations are looking for. We’re not becoming a job board and won’t post individual positions, but hopefully curating a list will prove useful for job seekers.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to be included, shoot me a line with your company’s name and how many positions you’re hiring for (if you don’t include the number, I will attempt to count). And, hey, if you end up landing a new gig based on something you found here, let me know on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bheater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a>.

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Most of the pitch deck teardowns to date (here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/ec-pitch-deck-teardowns/\">a handy list of the more than 30 we have published so far</a>) have been for institutional funding rounds, typically in the millions or tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars raised.</p>\n<p>Those are interesting to look at, of course, but I also know that many of you will be much earlier in your journey. I&#8217;ve been looking for a good example of an angel deck to share with you, and I found just that in <a href=\"https://laoshi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Laoshi</a>&#8216;s angel deck. The company tells me it raised $570,000 at a $5 million cap for its very early-stage language-learning app, explicitly targeted at Chinese tutors and their students.</p>\n<p>The deck ain&#8217;t fancy, and it isn&#8217;t perfect, but the company claims it was successful, so let&#8217;s take a look at what it got right — and what could&#8217;ve been improved.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We&#8217;re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/submit-your-pitch-deck-for-review/\">here&#8217;s how you can do that</a>. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Slides in this deck</h2>\n<p>Laoshi&#8217;s deck consists of 11 main slides and four appendix slides.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cover slide</li>\n<li>Problem slide</li>\n<li>Market slide</li>\n<li>Solution slide</li>\n<li>Competition slide</li>\n<li>Road map slide</li>\n<li>Team slide</li>\n<li>Teacher growth slide</li>\n<li>Teacher retention slide</li>\n<li>  Summary slide</li>\n<li> &#8220;Contact us&#8221; slide</li>\n<li> Appendices cover slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix I: Viral effect slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix II: Business model slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix III: &#8220;The ask&#8221; slide</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Three things to love</h2>\n<p>The deck is sparse and simple, which is pretty refreshing — a lot of early-stage decks don&#8217;t seem to have much of a story woven into them and try to cram way too much information (that isn&#8217;t really relevant) onto the slides.</p>\n<p>The overarching thing you have to remember for an angel deck is that your investors know they are in the business of high-risk investing. So, make clear why your company is a good bet, that you have a path to solving a real problem and acquiring a huge market and that you have the team to pull it off.</p>\n<h3>Team slide is A+</h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477072\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477072\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2477072\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Slide 7] A team slide should convince investors that you&#8217;re the right folks to build this company. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Laoshi</p></div>In an early-stage company, it&#8217;s often said you need a hacker, a hustler and a hipster (H<sup>3</sup>) to build a good founding team. The hacker is the person with the technical know-how to build the first couple of versions of the product. The hustler is the person who hauls in sales and investment and understands how the market works for this company. And the hipster is a person who can put designs together so the product looks fresh and cool and is easy to use.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m 100% on board with the H<sup>3</sup> ethos of founding team building — it&#8217;s far more important that you have the right, deep domain knowledge and drive (often expressed as &#8220;founder-market fit&#8221;), but you <em>also</em> need a breadth of skills to build a good startup. I do admit H<sup>3 </sup>often is a good template to check out a team&#8217;s skill set quickly and to determine whether there are major gaps in the team.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tPGjhipPcK\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/team-slide/\">The Team Slide is the most important slide in a startup pitch deck</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Team Slide is the most important slide in a startup pitch deck&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/team-slide/embed/#?secret=YqfKGo97ZR#?secret=tPGjhipPcK\" data-secret=\"tPGjhipPcK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>This team slide does two things: It shows that the team is international and distributed. It is diverse and experienced. And it manages — in the box at the bottom — to show that the team has market-relevant experience. Now, I would still need a voice-over to find out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How did the team meet?</li>\n<li>What are each team member&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses?</li>\n<li>What&#8217;s missing from the team?</li>\n<li>Why can this team deliver in a way that nobody else can?</li>\n<li>What is the hiring plan for the current fundraise?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But as a base-level team slide, this ticks a lot of boxes.

As an investor, I think this would be one of the more important slides. I&#8217;d love to see where the business is now, as well. For example, when the company says its TAC (tutor acquisition cost) is $50, what is it actually seeing as its TAC right now? If it assumes that each tutor has five students, how is that showing up in practice?</p>\n<p>Having said that, these numbers are super important in your conversations with your investors; essentially, you&#8217;re showing how you are thinking about your business and your market and that you understand the levers in your business. In other words: What if every tutor had 10 students instead of five? What if every tutor cost $100 to acquire instead of $50? By plugging all of that into a model and running experiments to increase your trust in the model, you can get a long way toward building a great picture of your business in numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/\">How to understand the financial levers in your business</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to understand the financial levers in your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/embed/#?secret=tVdedsvzt2#?secret=uZrz8dmeZE\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Laoshi could have improved or done differently, along with the company&#8217;s full pitch deck!</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/sample-angel-pitch-deck-laoshi/\">Pitch Deck Teardown: Laoshi&#8217;s $570K angel deck</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/haje-jan-kamps/\">Haje Jan Kamps</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

I&#8217;ve been looking for a good example of an angel deck to share with you, and I found just that in <a href=\"https://laoshi.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Laoshi</a>&#8216;s angel deck. The company tells me it raised $570,000 at a $5 million cap for its very early-stage language-learning app, explicitly targeted at Chinese tutors and their students.</p>\n<p>The deck ain&#8217;t fancy, and it isn&#8217;t perfect, but the company claims it was successful, so let&#8217;s take a look at what it got right — and what could&#8217;ve been improved.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We&#8217;re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/28/submit-your-pitch-deck-for-review/\">here&#8217;s how you can do that</a>. </em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Slides in this deck</h2>\n<p>Laoshi&#8217;s deck consists of 11 main slides and four appendix slides.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cover slide</li>\n<li>Problem slide</li>\n<li>Market slide</li>\n<li>Solution slide</li>\n<li>Competition slide</li>\n<li>Road map slide</li>\n<li>Team slide</li>\n<li>Teacher growth slide</li>\n<li>Teacher retention slide</li>\n<li>  Summary slide</li>\n<li> &#8220;Contact us&#8221; slide</li>\n<li> Appendices cover slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix I: Viral effect slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix II: Business model slide</li>\n<li>  Appendix III: &#8220;The ask&#8221; slide</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Three things to love</h2>\n<p>The deck is sparse and simple, which is pretty refreshing — a lot of early-stage decks don&#8217;t seem to have much of a story woven into them and try to cram way too much information (that isn&#8217;t really relevant) onto the slides.</p>\n<p>The overarching thing you have to remember for an angel deck is that your investors know they are in the business of high-risk investing. So, make clear why your company is a good bet, that you have a path to solving a real problem and acquiring a huge market and that you have the team to pull it off.</p>\n<h3>Team slide is A+</h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477072\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477072\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2477072\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-7.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Slide 7] A team slide should convince investors that you&#8217;re the right folks to build this company. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Laoshi</p></div>In an early-stage company, it&#8217;s often said you need a hacker, a hustler and a hipster (H<sup>3</sup>) to build a good founding team. The hacker is the person with the technical know-how to build the first couple of versions of the product. The hustler is the person who hauls in sales and investment and understands how the market works for this company.

If you don&#8217;t put it on the slide, the investor will be suspicious about why and ask for it anyway — you may as well skip that conversation and give &#8217;em what they need right off the bat.</p>\n<p>The thing you can learn from this slide as a startup is to be deeply aware of the metrics that are going to help you build and deliver your business.</p>\n<h3>Business model front and center</h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2477186\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2477186\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2477186\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=1200,674 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/LaoshiAngelPitchDeckTechCrunchPitchDeckTeardown-slide-14-biz-mod.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2477186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">[Slide 14] It&#8217;s always a good idea to show that you <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/\">understand the levers in your business</a>. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Laoshi</p></div>Gotta say, I don&#8217;t love the dark-gray-on-light-gray design, and it&#8217;s curious to me that this is in the appendix rather than in the core deck. As an investor, I think this would be one of the more important slides. I&#8217;d love to see where the business is now, as well. For example, when the company says its TAC (tutor acquisition cost) is $50, what is it actually seeing as its TAC right now? If it assumes that each tutor has five students, how is that showing up in practice?</p>\n<p>Having said that, these numbers are super important in your conversations with your investors; essentially, you&#8217;re showing how you are thinking about your business and your market and that you understand the levers in your business. In other words: What if every tutor had 10 students instead of five? What if every tutor cost $100 to acquire instead of $50? By plugging all of that into a model and running experiments to increase your trust in the model, you can get a long way toward building a great picture of your business in numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/\">How to understand the financial levers in your business</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to understand the financial levers in your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-to-understand-the-financial-levers-in-your-business/embed/#?secret=tVdedsvzt2#?secret=uZrz8dmeZE\" data-secret=\"uZrz8dmeZE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Laoshi could have improved or done differently, along with the company&#8217;s full pitch deck!</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/sample-angel-pitch-deck-laoshi/\">Pitch Deck Teardown: Laoshi&#8217;s $570K angel deck</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/haje-jan-kamps/\">Haje Jan Kamps</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.samooha.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samooha</a>, a startup developing a &#8220;cross-cloud&#8221; data collaboration platform, today announced that it raised $12.5 million in a funding tranche backed by Altimeter Capital and Snowflake Ventures, among others. CEO Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan says that the cash infusion &#8212; Samooha&#8217;s first &#8212; will be put toward product development and hiring; the plan is to grow the startup&#8217;s team from 14 developers to roughly 20 by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>So, you might be wondering, what exactly does Samooha do? In brief, the platform lets businesses securely share, collaborate on and gain insights from their and their partners&#8217; data, regardless of the underlying cloud and data stack.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a new concept. &#8220;Data clean rooms&#8221; have been around for a while, pitched both by tech giants and startups as the ideal solution for sharing sensitive data across computing environments. Just a few years ago, Harbr <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/harbr-raises-38-5m-to-help-enterprises-exchange-and-share-big-data-troves-securely/\">raised</a> $38.5 million for its tech to help enterprises securely exchange and share big data troves. InfoSum and Decentriq also offer secure data-sharing tools, while Amazon Web Services recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/29/aws-gets-data-clean-rooms-for-analytics-data/\">launched</a> a new data clean room product &#8212; called Clean Rooms, appropriately &#8212; aimed at organizations that regularly share data with outside partners.</p>\n<p>To the extent Samooha&#8217;s differentiated, it leans heavily on the Snowflake ecosystem &#8212; which isn&#8217;t exactly surprising given Snowflake&#8217;s involvement in the startup&#8217;s fundraising. A native app on Snowflake, Samooha provides a no-code UI customers can use to access and build clean room apps. The underlying trust boundary of Snowflake&#8217;s native apps framework provides the secure computation environment, Sivaramakrishnan explained in an interview with TechCrunch, while <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">eliminating the need for any data migration.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479491\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479491\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2479491\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp\" alt=\"Samooh\" width=\"1024\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp 1236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=768,472 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=1200,738 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cddd8c_e281d6bfbcd9478e985df64c761c69ce_mv2-transformed.webp?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samooha</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;Security guarantees are enforced both technically via cryptographic multi-party computation technologies and with user-defined policies like approved query templates. This powers fast and secure analysis on joint data in the clean room,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Think of a very intuitive collaboration product experience like Slack where you are not simply communicating with co-workers in a channel but are actually learning, sharing and collaborating around data owned by you and your partner by running analytics workloads without moving and securing data in that channel or room.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samooha intends to go after verticals it believes might be especially underserved, like healthcare, financial services, advertising, retail and entertainment. Media in particular could prove to be lucrative; Gartner <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/27472/AndrewFrank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicts</a> that by 2023, 80% of advertisers with media budgets of $1 billion or more will use data clean rooms.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Sivaramakrishnan claims that Samooha already has Fortune 500 customers, although she wouldn&#8217;t name names. The sales pitch was made easier by the pandemic, she says, because it shone light on the need for data collaboration in a safe, secure fashion across industries.</p>\n<p>It probably depends on the industry &#8212; an August 2022 <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/the-rundown-the-hope-hype-and-reality-of-data-clean-rooms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> by Habu found that over half of marketing professionals have never used a data clean room. But Samooha&#8217;s early traction suggests that there&#8217;s some truth to Sivaramakrishnan&#8217;s claims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Broadly speaking, leveraging customer, consumer and enterprise data is a fact of life for any industry and use case. But most businesses have an incomplete view of customer and consumer data,&#8221; Sivaramakrishnan said. &#8220;The pandemic shone light on the need for data collaboration in a safe, secure fashion across multiple industries, be that healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics, and more  . . . Our technology and product approach, coupled with the commercial model, gives us conviction that we are uniquely solving for a critical enterprise data function and hence, has the potential to withstand headwinds.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/samooh-launches-with-tech-that-lets-companies-share-data-securely/\">Samooha launches with tech that lets companies securely share data</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/\">Kyle Wiggers</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

This powers fast and secure analysis on joint data in the clean room,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Think of a very intuitive collaboration product experience like Slack where you are not simply communicating with co-workers in a channel but are actually learning, sharing and collaborating around data owned by you and your partner by running analytics workloads without moving and securing data in that channel or room.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Samooha intends to go after verticals it believes might be especially underserved, like healthcare, financial services, advertising, retail and entertainment. Media in particular could prove to be lucrative; Gartner <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/analyst/27472/AndrewFrank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicts</a> that by 2023, 80% of advertisers with media budgets of $1 billion or more will use data clean rooms.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Sivaramakrishnan claims that Samooha already has Fortune 500 customers, although she wouldn&#8217;t name names. The sales pitch was made easier by the pandemic, she says, because it shone light on the need for data collaboration in a safe, secure fashion across industries.</p>\n<p>It probably depends on the industry &#8212; an August 2022 <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/the-rundown-the-hope-hype-and-reality-of-data-clean-rooms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> by Habu found that over half of marketing professionals have never used a data clean room. But Samooha&#8217;s early traction suggests that there&#8217;s some truth to Sivaramakrishnan&#8217;s claims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Broadly speaking, leveraging customer, consumer and enterprise data is a fact of life for any industry and use case. But most businesses have an incomplete view of customer and consumer data,&#8221; Sivaramakrishnan said. &#8220;The pandemic shone light on the need for data collaboration in a safe, secure fashion across multiple industries, be that healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain and logistics, and more  . . . Our technology and product approach, coupled with the commercial model, gives us conviction that we are uniquely solving for a critical enterprise data function and hence, has the potential to withstand headwinds.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/samooh-launches-with-tech-that-lets-companies-share-data-securely/\">Samooha launches with tech that lets companies securely share data</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/kyle-wiggers/\">Kyle Wiggers</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Europe has moved a step closer to having dedicated rules on online political ad targeting and transparency after the European Parliament fixed its negotiating position &#8212; paving the way for talks to start between MEPs and member states to agree to a final compromise text that can be passed into pan-EU law.</p>\n<p>MEPs said they hope agreement can be reached in time to have the regulation in place for the next elections to the EU&#8217;s Parliament &#8212; in 2024.</p>\n<p>Parliamentarians voted for a series of changes to the Commission&#8217;s original (rather weak) proposal, which was presented back in<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/\"> November 2021 </a>&#8212; saying they&#8217;ve beefed up the draft so that only data &#8220;explicitly provided&#8221; for online political advertising can be used by advert providers for this purpose.</p>\n<p>MEP Patrick Breyer, a co-negotiator on the file in the parliament&#8217;s civil liberties (LIBE) committee, dubbed it &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/eu-lawmakers-vow-to-ban-surveillance-based-political-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a good day for democracy</a>&#8221; &#8212; highlighting some of the agreed amendments parliamentarians want to see, including a stipulation that refusing consent for political ads targeting must be as simple as giving it (so no consent dark patterns); another that &#8216;do not track&#8217; browser settings must be respected without hassling the user with more consent prompts (so no forcing consent by tiring web users who&#8217;ve already refused with fresh pop-ups); and a requirement that users who refuse consent should still be allowed access to the platforms (so no forcing consent, period).</p>\n<p>MEPs backed the negotiating mandate on the file by a large majority &#8212; of 433 votes in favor and 61 against (and 110 abstentions).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Platforms would be banned from running opaque ad delivery algorithms to determine who should see a political ad; they would only be able to select recipients randomly in the pool of people delineated by the targeting parameters chosen by the sponsor,&#8221; Breyer added in a press release rounding up key changes MEPs have proposed.</p>\n<p>These also include a proposal for a 60 day pre-election (or referendum) period &#8212; during which there would be further limits on political message targeting, with MEPs wanting to restrict this to only a voter’s language and the constituency they live in to avoid the hyper-segmentation of voters that&#8217;s possible thanks to &#8220;personalized&#8221; political ads that have been shown to be so toxic to democratic accountability.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Microtargeting, a strategy that uses consumer data and demographics to identify the interests of specific individuals, will therefore not be possible,&#8221; the parliament suggests in a <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230130IPR70208/meps-vote-for-tougher-rules-on-political-advertising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>In other changes, MEPs have also taken aim at foreign money seeking to influence EU elections &#8212; and proposed that non-EU based entities should be banned from financing political advertisements in the EU.</p>\n<p>Although how effectively such a ban would or could be policed is another matter. (&#8220;To determine where such an entity is established, the relevant authorities should take into account where the ultimate controller of this entity is located,&#8221; is what the parliament says on that.)</p>\n<p>MEPs have made other changes they say are aimed at improving transparency around political ads &#8212; such as pushing for the creation of an online repository for &#8220;all online political advertisements and related data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It should be easier to obtain information on who is financing an advert, on its cost, and the origin of the money used,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Other pieces of information which should also be published include whether an advertisement has been suspended for violating the rules, on the specific groups of individuals targeted and what personal data were used for this, and the views and engagement with the advertisement. MEPs aim to give journalists a specific right to obtain such information.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"ep-wysiwig_paragraph\">The Commission&#8217;s original proposal had proposed transparency labels for political ads, as well as some restrictions on microtargeting &#8212; but the vast majority of MEPs want to see tougher regulation of an arena where tech has gained a toxic reputation as a cheap, powerful and largely consequence-free tool for fiddling with democracy.</p>\n<p class=\"ep-wysiwig_paragraph\">Hence they&#8217;ve also proposed the possibility of having periodic penalties levied for repeat violations &#8212; and the obligation for large ad service providers to suspend their services for 15 days with a particular client in the case of serious and systemic infringements. They also want the Commission to be able to introduce EU-wide &#8220;minimum sanctions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MEPs look keen to avoid any risk of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/gdpr-enforcement-reform-dpa-oversight/\">forum shopping at the member state level</a> from undermining the rules by creating fresh workarounds &#8212; saying their adopted text both strengthens the powers of national data protection authorities (which will be expected to oversee compliance) and empowers the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to &#8220;take over an investigation into an infringement and enforce the rules&#8221;; that is, if a DPA is finding it hard to do their duty and crack down on violators.</p>\n<p>Breyer even directly names the (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/meta-ads-noyb-epdb-gdpr-complaint/\">much criticized</a>) Irish Data Protection Commission as a risk in this context, writing: &#8220;If a data protection authority such as the Irish DPA fails to enforce the rules against large online platforms, the EDPB would be able to take over.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In cases of illegal political ads targeting [the EDPB[] will not only be able to impose financial sanctions but also to temporarily suspend the targeting of ads by advertisers who seriously and systematically violated the rules. This ensures that more affluent sponsors are not able to simply factor in the price of financial sanctions in their budget,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, MEP and rapporteur for the file, Sandro Gozi, also said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is too much undue interference in our democratic processes. As legislators we have a responsibility to fight this but also to ensure debate remains open and free. This law will not kill political advertising, despite rumours spread by large online platforms. Nor will it stymie our freedom of expression. It will only limit abusive political advertising.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The European Council agreed its <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/13/transparency-and-targeting-of-political-advertising-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">negotiating mandate</a> on the regulation back in December &#8212; saying then that it wants to build on the Commission&#8217;s proposal by providing &#8220;greater legal certainty&#8221; regarding the scope of the regulation and around some of the key definitions, including in areas such as what is to be considered political advertising and how to identify a political ad.</p>\n<p>It also sought to claim credit for proposing stronger transparency measures. Although the Council largely aligned with the Commission&#8217;s more limited approach on restricting political microtargeting &#8212; saying it wanted to ban targeting and amplification techniques using &#8220;sensitive&#8221; personal data, including inferred data, unless an adult &#8220;explicitly consents&#8221; or is &#8220;a member or former member of a specifically defined not-for-profit body processing the sensitive data, or is in regular contact with it.&#8221; (But agreeing that the processing of minors&#8217; data for political ads should be entirely banned.)</p>\n<p>While the parliament&#8217;s amendments propose to go further in restricting behaviorally targeted political ads, there could still be scope for loopholes &#8212; as Breyer points out that limiting the application of the restrictions to &#8220;political advertising services&#8221; could, for instance, open a loophole for circumventing the rules if campaigns elect to directly send personally targeted letters, emails, or text messages &#8220;systematically and at large scale.&#8221; Though he suggests MEPs may push to try to address such a scenario in the forthcoming trilogue talks.</p>\n<p>Another gap the regulation does not address is organic, self-posted political content &#8212; which is (currently) excluded from the proposed targeting restrictions. So there&#8217;s also a risk that election fiddlers could fly under the radar by using fake social media accounts to post and amplify political propaganda &#8212; something that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/meta-and-twitter-graphika-us-influence-campaign/\">already happens</a> at scale, of course. So that looks like another major weak point.</p>\n<p>That said, MEPs previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/\">pushed for</a> &#8212; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/23/digital-services-act-political-deal-dsa/\">and won</a> &#8212; some softer but more general limits on behavioral targeting via the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/23/digital-services-act-political-deal-dsa/\">Digital Services Act</a> (which applies to digital intermediary services and platforms) &#8212; including a ban on the processing of minors&#8217; data for targeting ads and a ban on the use of sensitive data for ad targeting of adults. So the scope for tracking and profiling web users in order to target them with &#8220;personalized&#8221; content is facing a growing range of restrictions in the EU &#8212; where adtech platforms are also seeing an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/iab-tcf-gdpr-breaches/\">increase in enforcements</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/04/facebook-instagram-gdpr-forced-consent-final-decisions/\">breaches of existing data protection</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/\">ePrivacy rules</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wgy8FPNSne\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/\">Europe offers tepid set of political ads transparency rules</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe offers tepid set of political ads transparency rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/embed/#?secret=CSIRbMxbc4#?secret=wgy8FPNSne\" data-secret=\"wgy8FPNSne\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Q9HUnWvJ6g\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/\">European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/embed/#?secret=Tpv5YhCX48#?secret=Q9HUnWvJ6g\" data-secret=\"Q9HUnWvJ6g\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/eu-political-ads-transparency-rules-parliament-mandate/\">Political ads face tougher targeting restrictions in EU if MEPs get their way</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-lomas/\">Natasha Lomas</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

So the scope for tracking and profiling web users in order to target them with &#8220;personalized&#8221; content is facing a growing range of restrictions in the EU &#8212; where adtech platforms are also seeing an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/iab-tcf-gdpr-breaches/\">increase in enforcements</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/04/facebook-instagram-gdpr-forced-consent-final-decisions/\">breaches of existing data protection</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/\">ePrivacy rules</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wgy8FPNSne\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/\">Europe offers tepid set of political ads transparency rules</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe offers tepid set of political ads transparency rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/eu-political-ads-transparency-proposal/embed/#?secret=CSIRbMxbc4#?secret=wgy8FPNSne\" data-secret=\"wgy8FPNSne\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Q9HUnWvJ6g\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/\">European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;European parliament backs big limits on tracking ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking/embed/#?secret=Tpv5YhCX48#?secret=Q9HUnWvJ6g\" data-secret=\"Q9HUnWvJ6g\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/eu-political-ads-transparency-rules-parliament-mandate/\">Political ads face tougher targeting restrictions in EU if MEPs get their way</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-lomas/\">Natasha Lomas</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

Scotland-based Munro is specifically targeting farmers, miners and those who work in heavy industry sectors. The company, which was founded in 2021 by Peterson and Ross Anderson, has said it plans to bring its Munro MK_1 to market in 2024.</p>\n<p>Bollinger Motors, a Michigan-based startup founded by Robert Bollinger in 2015, is focused on producing all-electric commercial vehicles for classes 3 through 6. The company initially planned to produce the Bollinger B1 and B2 off-road electric SUV and pickup trucks. It later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/ev-startup-bollinger-targets-commercial-industry-with-its-new-chassis/#!\">introduced a chassis</a> designed for a class 3 commercial vehicle with the aim to expand its customer base.</p>\n<p>Bollinger paused development on its B1 and B2 vehicles in January 2022. Nine months later, Mullen Automotive, an EV startup that went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, took <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/08/mullen-acquires-controlling-interest-in-ev-startup-bollinger-motors/\">a 60% stake</a> in Bollinger. The transaction injected a needed $148.2 million into the startup.</p>\n<p>The companies said, at the time, that the investment would help fast-track the development of Bollinger’s class commercial electric trucks, including a class 4 vehicle expected in 2023, and help it resume its consumer truck program. B4 production is now slated to begin in early 2024.</p>\n<p>That extra capital seems to have done the job. The B1 and B2 consumer trucks are back on track, according to Robert Bollinger, who added that the company will announce production timing at a later date. Bollinger has working prototypes of the B4 and is planning pilot programs this summer.</p>\n<p>Bollinger still maintains its own board of directors and Robert Bollinger continues to serve as the CEO. When asked about the lawsuit, Robert Bollinger said Mullen isn&#8217;t mentioned in the lawsuit because the company retains ownership of the IP portfolio and has the obligation of defending it.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/bollinger-motors-sues-munro-vehicles-over-similarity-of-its-evs/\">Bollinger Motors sues Munro Vehicles over similarity of its EVs</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/kirsten-korosec/\">Kirsten Korosec</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

Scotland-based Munro is specifically targeting farmers, miners and those who work in heavy industry sectors. The company, which was founded in 2021 by Peterson and Ross Anderson, has said it plans to bring its Munro MK_1 to market in 2024.</p>\n<p>Bollinger Motors, a Michigan-based startup founded by Robert Bollinger in 2015, is focused on producing all-electric commercial vehicles for classes 3 through 6. The company initially planned to produce the Bollinger B1 and B2 off-road electric SUV and pickup trucks. It later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/ev-startup-bollinger-targets-commercial-industry-with-its-new-chassis/#!\">introduced a chassis</a> designed for a class 3 commercial vehicle with the aim to expand its customer base.</p>\n<p>Bollinger paused development on its B1 and B2 vehicles in January 2022. Nine months later, Mullen Automotive, an EV startup that went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, took <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/08/mullen-acquires-controlling-interest-in-ev-startup-bollinger-motors/\">a 60% stake</a> in Bollinger. The transaction injected a needed $148.2 million into the startup.</p>\n<p>The companies said, at the time, that the investment would help fast-track the development of Bollinger’s class commercial electric trucks, including a class 4 vehicle expected in 2023, and help it resume its consumer truck program. B4 production is now slated to begin in early 2024.</p>\n<p>That extra capital seems to have done the job. The B1 and B2 consumer trucks are back on track, according to Robert Bollinger, who added that the company will announce production timing at a later date. Bollinger has working prototypes of the B4 and is planning pilot programs this summer.</p>\n<p>Bollinger still maintains its own board of directors and Robert Bollinger continues to serve as the CEO. When asked about the lawsuit, Robert Bollinger said Mullen isn&#8217;t mentioned in the lawsuit because the company retains ownership of the IP portfolio and has the obligation of defending it.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/bollinger-motors-sues-munro-vehicles-over-similarity-of-its-evs/\">Bollinger Motors sues Munro Vehicles over similarity of its EVs</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/kirsten-korosec/\">Kirsten Korosec</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Shopify powers a massive number of e-commerce sites, so it&#8217;s also no surprise that there is a vast ecosystem of tools around it that help these merchants manage all aspects of running their stores. <a href=\"https://www.triplewhale.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Triple Whale</a>, a Columbus, Ohio–based startup, focuses on providing Shopify store owners with a single platform that brings together all of their analytics into a single service to help them improve their conversion numbers and get better insights into their marketing campaigns. Using all of this data, the team is now also starting to build smart, AI-based tools on top of it.</p>\n<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series B round from NFX and Elephant, with strategic participation from Shopify itself. That&#8217;s on top of the company&#8217;s 2022 $24 million Series A round (led by Elephant) and its $2.7 million seed round (led by NFX). To raise this much these days, startups have to show considerable traction. The team says it saw 1,400% year-over-year growth, with over 5,000 brands now using its service. The company notes that these brands generated over $14 billion in sales last year.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479355\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479355\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2479355\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png 1727w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=1200,672 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Triple Whale</p></div></p>\n<p>Triple Whale was co-founded by AJ Orbach (CEO), Ivan Chernykh (CTO) and Maxx Blank (COO). Orbach and Blank, who met as young entrepreneurs in Jerusalem, came into the Shopify ecosystem by running their own brands and stores on the platform, with Chernykh joining them at Triple Whale as their technical co-founder. The idea behind Triple Whale was to take a lot of the processes they used to run their stores and turn them into a product.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I took the spreadsheets that I was using to track my ad spent and the overall KPIs that I needed to watch, and we took that and we productized it and made it into a mobile app that a lot of people liked,&#8221; Orbach explained. &#8220;We took a lot of the playbook from what we learned in D2C with influencer marketing and really applied it to a community that we found on Twitter &#8212; which was very influential in the D2C space and we used that playbook to get a lot of the traction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just around this time in late 2020, Apple launched iOS 14 and with that, its new privacy features. This meant that many store owners couldn&#8217;t rely on the data they were getting from Facebook anymore, so Triple Whale built a <a href=\"https://www.triplewhale.com/triple-pixel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new attribution system</a> for them (dubbed Pixel), which is now at the core of its platform.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479354\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479354\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2479354 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AJ Orbach (CEO), Maxx Blank (COO) and Ivan Chernykh (CTO) <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Batel Ella Yehudai</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;The data coming from Facebook was just a mess. There was no way we could make any sense of it. And so we said, we have to build attribution,&#8221; explained Blank. &#8220;First of all, our clients are suffering because they don&#8217;t have visibility, but also, if we want to start building automation, we need to correct data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With Pixel, Triple Whale can offer first-party attribution and real-time data for merchants, but what the team is now focused on is building out its automation, machine learning and generative AI-based tooling around that. Some of that is pretty straightforward, like its new rules engine and &#8220;AI Timing&#8221; feature, which helps merchants automate their media buying, for example.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will give you the best time to buy over the week based on your data and then you&#8217;ll be able to use our rules engine to, for example, shut the ad off between 12 and 6 at night so you don&#8217;t waste money,&#8221; Blank explained.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479391\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479391\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2479391 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1082\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=222,300 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=768,1039 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=503,680 503w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479391\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Triple Whale</p></div></p>\n<p>Using generative AI, the team also plans to soon launch new services that will help merchants generate ad copy and images. It&#8217;s also soon launching a new tool, Lighthouse, which looks for anomalies (maybe a product is selling significantly faster than usual) and then alerts users and recommends potential actions to capitalize on this.</p>\n<p>As the founders noted, the core idea was always to offer a centralized data platform, a layer of visualization on top of that and then automation tools that help users leverage this data to grow their businesses.</p>\n<p>The team tells me that many of the brands on its service are currently generating between $1 million and $50 million per year. But with many larger brands now also starting to use its service, the team is also starting to look into how it can best serve these larger customers. The company&#8217;s pricing is based on which tools a merchant wants to use, but its full-stack suite currently sells for $400/month, with the dashboard without Pixel attribution costing $100/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Triple Whale has built an excellent marketing analytics platform that equips multi-channel merchants with the marketing insights they need in a fast-evolving online retail landscape,&#8221; said Sabrina Frias, corporate development manager at Shopify. &#8220;This strategic investment will help scaling merchants better understand the impact of their marketing spend to scale operations. We look forward to seeing what this team can do!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/triple-whale-raises-25m-for-its-shopify-data-platform/\">Triple Whale raises $25M for its smart Shopify data platform</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/\">Frederic Lardinois</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

Using all of this data, the team is now also starting to build smart, AI-based tools on top of it.</p>\n<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series B round from NFX and Elephant, with strategic participation from Shopify itself. That&#8217;s on top of the company&#8217;s 2022 $24 million Series A round (led by Elephant) and its $2.7 million seed round (led by NFX). To raise this much these days, startups have to show considerable traction. The team says it saw 1,400% year-over-year growth, with over 5,000 brands now using its service. The company notes that these brands generated over $14 billion in sales last year.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479355\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479355\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2479355\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png 1727w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=1200,672 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TechCrunch-Screenshot.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479355\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Triple Whale</p></div></p>\n<p>Triple Whale was co-founded by AJ Orbach (CEO), Ivan Chernykh (CTO) and Maxx Blank (COO). Orbach and Blank, who met as young entrepreneurs in Jerusalem, came into the Shopify ecosystem by running their own brands and stores on the platform, with Chernykh joining them at Triple Whale as their technical co-founder. The idea behind Triple Whale was to take a lot of the processes they used to run their stores and turn them into a product.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I took the spreadsheets that I was using to track my ad spent and the overall KPIs that I needed to watch, and we took that and we productized it and made it into a mobile app that a lot of people liked,&#8221; Orbach explained. &#8220;We took a lot of the playbook from what we learned in D2C with influencer marketing and really applied it to a community that we found on Twitter &#8212; which was very influential in the D2C space and we used that playbook to get a lot of the traction.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just around this time in late 2020, Apple launched iOS 14 and with that, its new privacy features. This meant that many store owners couldn&#8217;t rely on the data they were getting from Facebook anymore, so Triple Whale built a <a href=\"https://www.triplewhale.com/triple-pixel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new attribution system</a> for them (dubbed Pixel), which is now at the core of its platform.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479354\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479354\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2479354 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg 1140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/triple-whale_founders.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479354\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AJ Orbach (CEO), Maxx Blank (COO) and Ivan Chernykh (CTO) <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Batel Ella Yehudai</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;The data coming from Facebook was just a mess. There was no way we could make any sense of it. And so we said, we have to build attribution,&#8221; explained Blank. &#8220;First of all, our clients are suffering because they don&#8217;t have visibility, but also, if we want to start building automation, we need to correct data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With Pixel, Triple Whale can offer first-party attribution and real-time data for merchants, but what the team is now focused on is building out its automation, machine learning and generative AI-based tooling around that. Some of that is pretty straightforward, like its new rules engine and &#8220;AI Timing&#8221; feature, which helps merchants automate their media buying, for example.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will give you the best time to buy over the week based on your data and then you&#8217;ll be able to use our rules engine to, for example, shut the ad off between 12 and 6 at night so you don&#8217;t waste money,&#8221; Blank explained.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479391\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479391\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2479391 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1082\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=111,150 111w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=222,300 222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=768,1039 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=503,680 503w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/62b0d9d1f0962572431ec03a_628cbecbea921a8626bd0684_Group-556-min-1-p-800.png?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479391\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Triple Whale</p></div></p>\n<p>Using generative AI, the team also plans to soon launch new services that will help merchants generate ad copy and images. It&#8217;s also soon launching a new tool, Lighthouse, which looks for anomalies (maybe a product is selling significantly faster than usual) and then alerts users and recommends potential actions to capitalize on this.</p>\n<p>As the founders noted, the core idea was always to offer a centralized data platform, a layer of visualization on top of that and then automation tools that help users leverage this data to grow their businesses.</p>\n<p>The team tells me that many of the brands on its service are currently generating between $1 million and $50 million per year. But with many larger brands now also starting to use its service, the team is also starting to look into how it can best serve these larger customers. The company&#8217;s pricing is based on which tools a merchant wants to use, but its full-stack suite currently sells for $400/month, with the dashboard without Pixel attribution costing $100/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Triple Whale has built an excellent marketing analytics platform that equips multi-channel merchants with the marketing insights they need in a fast-evolving online retail landscape,&#8221; said Sabrina Frias, corporate development manager at Shopify. &#8220;This strategic investment will help scaling merchants better understand the impact of their marketing spend to scale operations. We look forward to seeing what this team can do!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/triple-whale-raises-25m-for-its-shopify-data-platform/\">Triple Whale raises $25M for its smart Shopify data platform</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/frederic-lardinois/\">Frederic Lardinois</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

Rhythm City is set to launch on February 4 and offers mini-games and social roleplaying experiences like becoming a musician and owning a house and car.</p>\n<p>The NFL claims that Saweetie will give a “family-friendly,” fully motion-captured performance and sing her hit songs like “Tap-In.” The concert will re-air every hour until Sunday, February 12.</p>\n<p>Fans that virtually attend the Saweetie Super Bowl Concert can also get digital items on the Roblox marketplace or win items by finishing challenges. The digital collection includes wearable hairstyles, hats, boots, headphones and sweatsuits, which are based on Saweetie’s merchandise and her album looks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to bring this iconic moment to the metaverse and share my music with a whole new audience in such a unique way! As an artist, innovator, and football fan, to be able to perform during Super Bowl LVII weekend in this new world – Rhythm City on Roblox – is something I never imagined that I would be involved in. I am very grateful and happy about this opportunity,&#8221; Saweetie said in a statement.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479401\" style=\"width: 508px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479401\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2479401\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg?w=498\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg 498w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jpeg.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479401\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roblox/NFL</p></div></p>\n<p>The NFL is also launching <a href=\"http://roblox.com/supernfltycoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super NFL Tycoon</a> within Roblox. The metaverse experience allows users to pretend they’re NFL team owners, draft a team and build a stadium. Super NFL Tycoon will launch on February 4 to coincide with the virtual Super Bowl concert. Users can move between Super NFL Tycoon and Rhythm City through a designated portal.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Interestingly, the experience &#8212; which is presented by the global financial technology platform Intuit &#8212; is also an attempt to teach younger users “important financial concepts in a fun and engaging manner,” said Lara Balazs, Intuit&#8217;s chief marketing officer and general manager of Strategic Partner Group. So, while users fantasize about owning an NFL team, they can also learn how to manage cash flow, payroll, taxes and customer acquisition (because that’s supposed to be fun somehow).</p>\n<p>The concert, Super NFL Tycoon and Rhythm City are also developed in partnership with Gamefam, a gaming company across metaverse platforms.</p>\n<p>“Bringing a cultural moment like the Super Bowl to the metaverse with such innovative partners marks a shift in how brands are coming together to create the next generation of metaverse gaming experiences,&#8221; said Ricardo Briceno, chief business officer of Gamefam.</p>\n<p>This is the second year in a row that NFL and Roblox are offering the <a href=\"https://www.roblox.com/games/8649501395/UPDATE-9-NFL-Tycoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NFL Tycoon experience</a>. For the 2022 Super Bowl, Roblox users could attend an interactive event called “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLTycoon/status/1493321919264919552?s=20&amp;t=sbsXrQA4Wwi1LCuHJjyh0Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Destruction House</a>,” inspired by the Super Bowl LVI commercial.

    "title": "How Fictiv is making hardware manufacturing more like building software",
    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Over the past few years, we&#8217;ve spoken with hundreds of hardware startups, and there&#8217;s one phrase that has been showing up in almost every interview: &#8220;supply chains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They were always important for people shipping physical products, of course, but the pandemic and the international logistics chaos that resulted from it made the pain of getting components to factories and products from factories to warehouses, then to stores and to customers, all the more present.</p>\n<p>A few of the founders TechCrunch spoke to at CES in Las Vegas this year seemed to be optimistic, saying that some of the supply-chain crisis is on its way to being resolved, while others laughed at the suggestion that all of this is behind us. We decided to find out what the status is.</p>\n<p>I spoke with supply-chain experts <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fictiv</a> to figure out whether the light at the end of the tunnel is daylight or the headlights of an oncoming train. If anyone knows what&#8217;s going on, it&#8217;s Fictiv CEO Dave Evans. He&#8217;s been running the manufacturing platform for more than a decade; before that, he was part of the Advanced Manufacturing Group at the World Economic Forum and a lead hardware engineer at Ford. We talked to Evans about the status quo and the near future of hardware manufacturing, seen through the lens of startups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main problem for early-stage startups is that it&#8217;s really difficult to get someone to care. You might care about your product, but nobody else does because you&#8217;re too small. Suppliers will ask if you have volume. If you don&#8217;t, why would they work with you?&#8221; Evans said, pointing out that relationships are super important with whoever your supplier base is. He noted that you have to be the right size for your suppliers. If you&#8217;re too small, they don&#8217;t want to deal with you. But if you&#8217;re too big, that&#8217;s also a problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was at Ford, you know, there were a lot of great suppliers, but they only do $10 million a year. At Ford, we never worked with them, because there was simply too much risk.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2RceyZmnfQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/butcherbox-dry-ice/\">Why ButcherBox built two dry ice factories during the pandemic</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why ButcherBox built two dry ice factories during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/butcherbox-dry-ice/embed/#?secret=Gh2AKanhKT#?secret=2RceyZmnfQ\" data-secret=\"2RceyZmnfQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I asked Evans if the supply chain crisis was finally in the rearview mirror. When he was done laughing, he had a pretty simple answer: Nope.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it over? I would say, unequivocally, no. I think we&#8217;ve shifted from a conversation about &#8216;if&#8217; to a conversation about &#8216;when.&#8217; I don&#8217;t think we are at the peak of it by any means,&#8221; he said, adding that while the pandemic was a big hit, supply-chain resiliency itself has been a conversation among his peers for a very long time. &#8220;We can go back to 2019 and talk about trade wars. We can go to 2020 and talk about pandemics, the Suez Canal, we can talk about shipping delays and massive global conflict in Europe. We can talk about recessions and all of these things that disrupt global trade and supply chains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The big change that happened during the pandemic, however, was that supply-chain disruptions started showing up in the lives of people who weren&#8217;t supply-chain professionals. Average consumers suddenly couldn&#8217;t buy the kind of ketchup they wanted, or the new car they were excited about was delayed, or they couldn&#8217;t get the right stuff at the hardware store to renovate their homes.</p>\n<p>For businesses, disruptions were mostly hidden from view before the pandemic, something the chief supply chain officer would take care of.

      "#": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Over the past few years, we&#8217;ve spoken with hundreds of hardware startups, and there&#8217;s one phrase that has been showing up in almost every interview: &#8220;supply chains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They were always important for people shipping physical products, of course, but the pandemic and the international logistics chaos that resulted from it made the pain of getting components to factories and products from factories to warehouses, then to stores and to customers, all the more present.</p>\n<p>A few of the founders TechCrunch spoke to at CES in Las Vegas this year seemed to be optimistic, saying that some of the supply-chain crisis is on its way to being resolved, while others laughed at the suggestion that all of this is behind us. We decided to find out what the status is.</p>\n<p>I spoke with supply-chain experts <a href=\"https://www.fictiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fictiv</a> to figure out whether the light at the end of the tunnel is daylight or the headlights of an oncoming train. If anyone knows what&#8217;s going on, it&#8217;s Fictiv CEO Dave Evans. He&#8217;s been running the manufacturing platform for more than a decade; before that, he was part of the Advanced Manufacturing Group at the World Economic Forum and a lead hardware engineer at Ford. We talked to Evans about the status quo and the near future of hardware manufacturing, seen through the lens of startups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main problem for early-stage startups is that it&#8217;s really difficult to get someone to care. You might care about your product, but nobody else does because you&#8217;re too small. Suppliers will ask if you have volume. If you don&#8217;t, why would they work with you?&#8221; Evans said, pointing out that relationships are super important with whoever your supplier base is. He noted that you have to be the right size for your suppliers. If you&#8217;re too small, they don&#8217;t want to deal with you. But if you&#8217;re too big, that&#8217;s also a problem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was at Ford, you know, there were a lot of great suppliers, but they only do $10 million a year. At Ford, we never worked with them, because there was simply too much risk.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2RceyZmnfQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/butcherbox-dry-ice/\">Why ButcherBox built two dry ice factories during the pandemic</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content embed-iframe\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why ButcherBox built two dry ice factories during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/butcherbox-dry-ice/embed/#?secret=Gh2AKanhKT#?secret=2RceyZmnfQ\" data-secret=\"2RceyZmnfQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I asked Evans if the supply chain crisis was finally in the rearview mirror. When he was done laughing, he had a pretty simple answer: Nope.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Is it over? I would say, unequivocally, no. I think we&#8217;ve shifted from a conversation about &#8216;if&#8217; to a conversation about &#8216;when.&#8217; I don&#8217;t think we are at the peak of it by any means,&#8221; he said, adding that while the pandemic was a big hit, supply-chain resiliency itself has been a conversation among his peers for a very long time. &#8220;We can go back to 2019 and talk about trade wars. We can go to 2020 and talk about pandemics, the Suez Canal, we can talk about shipping delays and massive global conflict in Europe. We can talk about recessions and all of these things that disrupt global trade and supply chains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The big change that happened during the pandemic, however, was that supply-chain disruptions started showing up in the lives of people who weren&#8217;t supply-chain professionals. Average consumers suddenly couldn&#8217;t buy the kind of ketchup they wanted, or the new car they were excited about was delayed, or they couldn&#8217;t get the right stuff at the hardware store to renovate their homes.</p>\n<p>For businesses, disruptions were mostly hidden from view before the pandemic, something the chief supply chain officer would take care of. It went from a functional, practical problem that affected a part of the business to a management problem where the whole team suddenly started caring. Suddenly, everyone had to know why there were delays in shipping, gaping holes in the financial statements and questions from the board.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479014\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479014\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2479014\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dave-Evans.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dave Evans, CEO at Fictiv. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Fictiv</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think what this is doing is forcing companies to rethink their supply-chain strategies and modernize them, versus if we went back three, four years ago, people didn&#8217;t really care,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;Before Amazon, there wasn&#8217;t this much pressure to ship in two days, but now the supply chain is a critical business function for anybody that ships a physical good.

    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blockjoy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlockJoy</a>, a startup providing white label blockchain nodes as a service, raised a total of $12 million from its seed and Series A rounds, the company exclusi1vely shared with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The Boston-based startup aims to reduce operating costs by up to 80% for enterprises running staking nodes and APIs as a service, the two co-founders, Sean Carey and Chris Bruce, said to TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>“On <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/23/while-amazon-had-a-rocky-year-aws-remains-reliable-cash-cow/\">AWS</a>, it would cost $200 a month per node, but we rethought the web3 infrastructure and we are able to run those same nodes for about $11 a month, shaving about 80% of cost,” Bruce said.</p>\n<p>Carey, who’s also the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/helium-network/\">Helium</a> co-founder, and Bruce, a four-time founder, began BlockJoy as a staking service side project. “We started this completely by accident,” Carey said. “We wanted to stake tokens and the systems to do it weren&#8217;t sensible [&#8230;] so Chris and I worked together to create this project and the birth of BlockJoy happened.”</p>\n<p>BlockJoy was “never intended to be a company — it was supposed to be for friends and family,” Bruce shared. “But after six months, people were coming in and staking nodes with us, and six months into our launch, we were running 1,200 validators for the Helium Network.”</p>\n<p>Investors include Gradient Ventures, Draper Dragon, Dragon Roark, Active Capital, Borderless HNT and Renegade Ventures, among others.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The startup built BlockVisor, its patented blockchain node management software, which lets users run blockchain nodes on any infrastructure in an automated, cost-effective manner through a “point-and-click” user interface, Bruce said.</p>\n<p>This means enterprises using BlockJoy’s service can deploy and manage blockchains, nodes, validators and ETLs (extract, transform, load) with “a click of a button,” Carey noted.</p>\n<p>The capital will be used to launch BlockVisor, which is now open in beta mode. “It allows anyone to launch a node wherever they want on our infrastructure, their infrastructure or even through the cloud,” Bruce said.</p>\n<p>“BlockJoy is a web3 infrastructure company at a fundamental level,” Bruce said. “That means we have a platform that helps node operators like Blockdaemon, Alchemy or any exchange or business that runs nodes for their business.”</p>\n<p>The team currently works with a handful of crypto companies, including Binance, Crypto.com and the Helium Foundation, Carey shared. It’s also onboarding new blockchains, including Ethereum 2, Cosmos, Polygon, Solana, Algorand and Avalanche. By the end of its beta launch, BlockJoy aims to support about 25 blockchains, Bruce said.</p>\n<p>“We allow them to operate those nodes in a decentralized manner just like they’re running them on the cloud with software specifically designed for blockchain nodes,” Bruce said. It typically takes node operators four to six months to implement new protocols, but BlockJoy can implement them within a matter of days to weeks, he added.</p>\n<p>In the long term, BlockJoy hopes to make its technology more accessible so that running a node is easy enough that anyone can do it, Bruce said. “We want to provide infrastructure that’s drop-dead simple but not centralized. We want to see the proliferation of web3, and this is step one.”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/blockjoy-raises-12m-to-help-cut-operating-costs-for-businesses-running-blockchain-nodes/\">BlockJoy raises $12M to help cut operating costs for businesses running blockchain nodes</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/jacquelyn-melinek/\">Jacquelyn Melinek</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

It’s also onboarding new blockchains, including Ethereum 2, Cosmos, Polygon, Solana, Algorand and Avalanche. By the end of its beta launch, BlockJoy aims to support about 25 blockchains, Bruce said.</p>\n<p>“We allow them to operate those nodes in a decentralized manner just like they’re running them on the cloud with software specifically designed for blockchain nodes,” Bruce said. It typically takes node operators four to six months to implement new protocols, but BlockJoy can implement them within a matter of days to weeks, he added.</p>\n<p>In the long term, BlockJoy hopes to make its technology more accessible so that running a node is easy enough that anyone can do it, Bruce said. “We want to provide infrastructure that’s drop-dead simple but not centralized. We want to see the proliferation of web3, and this is step one.”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/blockjoy-raises-12m-to-help-cut-operating-costs-for-businesses-running-blockchain-nodes/\">BlockJoy raises $12M to help cut operating costs for businesses running blockchain nodes</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/jacquelyn-melinek/\">Jacquelyn Melinek</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"

    "title": "TikTok introduces a strike system for violations, tests a feature to ‘refresh’ the For You feed",
    "description": "<p id=\"speakable-summary\">TikTok today is announcing several changes to its service, including what it claims will be increased enforcement against bad actors as well as tests of new user-facing tools that will force a refresh of the app&#8217;s main algorithmic feed, known as the For You feed. The company said the changes are focused on keeping the platform both safe and entertaining for its users and creators alike.</p>\n<p>While all major social media companies have content guidelines, their enforcement varies. As is often the case, people who violate the rules and are subject to takedowns of their content or bans don&#8217;t always learn from their mistakes &#8212; they just become repeat violators. Today, TikTok&#8217;s enforcement system includes a variety of penalties, like temporary bans on posting or commenting, designed to reduce harmful content on the platform.</p>\n<p>However, admits TikTok&#8217;s Global Head of Product Policy Julie de Bailliencourt in an <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/supporting-creators-with-an-updated-account-enforcement-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement</a>, creators complain that the current system can be confusing to navigate &#8212; especially if they don&#8217;t typically break TikTok&#8217;s rules or have unknowingly violated policy, and aren&#8217;t sure why they&#8217;ve been penalized. What&#8217;s more, this system is not efficient at deterring repeat violators, the exec explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Repeat violators tend to follow a pattern – our analysis has found that almost 90% violate using the same feature consistently, and over 75% violate the same policy category repeatedly,&#8221; de Bailliencourt wrote.</p>\n<p>As a result, TikTok will move instead to a strike system, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similar to YouTube</a>. In all but the most severe cases, creators will accrue strikes as their content is removed. If they then reach a threshold of strikes within either a product feature (like comments or TikTok LIVE), or policy (like bullying or harassment), they will be permanently banned. The company said the threshold will vary depending on the violation and its potential to harm community members. It said, for instance, there may be a lower threshold for violating hateful content policies than there would be for posting low-harm spam.</p>\n<p>TikTok will still issue permanent bans for severe violations, like videos that are &#8220;promoting or threatening violence, showing or facilitating child sexual abuse material (CSAM), or showing real-world violence or torture,&#8221; the post said.</p>\n<p>The accumulated strikes will expire from an account&#8217;s record after 90 days, but accounts that &#8220;accrue a high number of cumulative strikes across policies and features&#8221; will be permanently banned. TikTok did not detail what a &#8220;high number&#8221; would be, nor did it share more information about what the thresholds are in the various areas. That could potentially cause more confusion among creators as they try to reverse engineer the system based on which accounts received strikes and why.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Creators will soon be able to track their own strikes and their account&#8217;s standing in the app, TikTok said, through an update to the Safety Center for creators. Here, they can view their own status and the status of the reports they&#8217;ve made on other videos or accounts. They&#8217;ll also be able to appeal strikes from this Safety Center if they feel they were given out in error. If the creator is close to a permanent ban, TikTok will notify them.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2479366\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2479366\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2479366 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png 1240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=768,690 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=680,611 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=1200,1078 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/account-standing-tiktok.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2479366\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>\n<p>Related to this, the company said it will also begin to test a new feature in select markets that will inform creators which videos of theirs have been marked as ineligible for recommendation to users&#8217; For You feeds, and why.</p>\n<p>For end users, however, another new test may be more interesting.</p>\n<p>Soon, TikTok will allow some users to tap a new &#8220;Refresh&#8221; button to receive an updated set of For You feed recommendations. Though TikTok&#8217;s feed is highly personalized and fairly addictive, many complain the content becomes stale as it doesn&#8217;t add enough variety after some time. With the new refresh button, which will be available in account settings, users will be able to force the app to bring &#8220;new, diversified content not based on previous activity or interactions&#8221; to their For You feed.</p>\n<p>After hitting the button, users will then begin to see content that&#8217;s based on their new interactions, a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. In addition to providing a refreshed feed, the company noted that the feature could serve as a way to support potentially vulnerable users who want to distance themselves from their current content experience.</p>\n<p>The changes to TikTok&#8217;s policies and product come on the heels of increased concern over the app&#8217;s ties to China and the risks it poses. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/16/tech/tiktok-state-restrictions/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Across the U.S.,</a> TikTok has been banned on government devices after executive orders from governors prohibited the app. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/tiktok-college-bans-texas-bytedance/\">Several universities</a> have banned the app on their Wi-Fi networks as well. And the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144519602/congress-is-about-to-ban-tiktok-from-u-s-government-phones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned TikTok from government devices</a> in a bill signed at the end of December. In response, TikTok has been taking meetings with officials, think tanks and public interest groups in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/technology/tiktok-bytedance-data-security.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times reported</a>, and this week <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-transparency-campaign-echoes-effort-by-huawei-to-ease-security-concerns-11675323193?mod=djemalertNEWS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invited media to tour its</a> Transparency and Accountability Center in LA.</p>\n<p>Amid the increasing calls for a nationwide ban in the U.S., TikTok has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/02/1153448116/tiktok-la-media-briefing-project-texas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working to convince the public</a> of its platform safety and rolling out new transparency tools that inform users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/20/tiktoks-tell-you-why-a-particular-video-appeared-in-for-you-feed/\">why videos were recommended</a> or allow them to<a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> filter out</a> specific content. However, with every new announcement, there comes a bit of bad press, too. For instance, it was revealed last month the company had a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=28fbcc3e6bfd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">secret heating button to make videos go viral</a>, and just before that, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/12/22/tiktok-tracks-forbes-journalists-bytedance/?sh=3cc215aa7da5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes reported TikTok had spied on</a> its journalists. These reveals have tarnished the company&#8217;s image further at a time when it&#8217;s trying to increase trust.</p>\n<p>TikTok says the refresh button will roll out in the &#8220;coming days&#8221; while the policy update is currently rolling out globally, and users will be notified as it&#8217;s available to them.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/tiktok-introduces-a-strike-system-for-violations-tests-a-feature-to-refresh-the-for-you-feed/\">TikTok introduces a strike system for violations, tests a feature to &#8216;refresh&#8217; the For You feed</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/sarah-perez/\">Sarah Perez</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>",

Though TikTok&#8217;s feed is highly personalized and fairly addictive, many complain the content becomes stale as it doesn&#8217;t add enough variety after some time. With the new refresh button, which will be available in account settings, users will be able to force the app to bring &#8220;new, diversified content not based on previous activity or interactions&#8221; to their For You feed.</p>\n<p>After hitting the button, users will then begin to see content that&#8217;s based on their new interactions, a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. In addition to providing a refreshed feed, the company noted that the feature could serve as a way to support potentially vulnerable users who want to distance themselves from their current content experience.</p>\n<p>The changes to TikTok&#8217;s policies and product come on the heels of increased concern over the app&#8217;s ties to China and the risks it poses. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/16/tech/tiktok-state-restrictions/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Across the U.S.,</a> TikTok has been banned on government devices after executive orders from governors prohibited the app. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/tiktok-college-bans-texas-bytedance/\">Several universities</a> have banned the app on their Wi-Fi networks as well. And the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144519602/congress-is-about-to-ban-tiktok-from-u-s-government-phones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned TikTok from government devices</a> in a bill signed at the end of December. In response, TikTok has been taking meetings with officials, think tanks and public interest groups in Washington, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/technology/tiktok-bytedance-data-security.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times reported</a>, and this week <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-transparency-campaign-echoes-effort-by-huawei-to-ease-security-concerns-11675323193?mod=djemalertNEWS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">invited media to tour its</a> Transparency and Accountability Center in LA.</p>\n<p>Amid the increasing calls for a nationwide ban in the U.S., TikTok has been <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/02/02/1153448116/tiktok-la-media-briefing-project-texas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working to convince the public</a> of its platform safety and rolling out new transparency tools that inform users <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/20/tiktoks-tell-you-why-a-particular-video-appeared-in-for-you-feed/\">why videos were recommended</a> or allow them to<a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/more-ways-for-our-community-to-enjoy-what-they-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> filter out</a> specific content. However, with every new announcement, there comes a bit of bad press, too. For instance, it was revealed last month the company had a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2023/01/20/tiktoks-secret-heating-button-can-make-anyone-go-viral/?sh=28fbcc3e6bfd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">secret heating button to make videos go viral</a>, and just before that, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/12/22/tiktok-tracks-forbes-journalists-bytedance/?sh=3cc215aa7da5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes reported TikTok had spied on</a> its journalists. These reveals have tarnished the company&#8217;s image further at a time when it&#8217;s trying to increase trust.</p>\n<p>TikTok says the refresh button will roll out in the &#8220;coming days&#8221; while the policy update is currently rolling out globally, and users will be notified as it&#8217;s available to them.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/02/tiktok-introduces-a-strike-system-for-violations-tests-a-feature-to-refresh-the-for-you-feed/\">TikTok introduces a strike system for violations, tests a feature to &#8216;refresh&#8217; the For You feed</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/author/sarah-perez/\">Sarah Perez</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a></p>"
